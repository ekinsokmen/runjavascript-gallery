* Use Shortcuts action to create x-callback-url
* Use Shortcuts to open scripts and integrate. [See this page](../integration/shortcuts/README.md)
* Use in-line editor and edit manually
* Use IOS Files app to copy files from other apps
* Use other apps like Working Copy to edit and store scrips. [See this page](../integration/working-copy/README.md).
